The CSV format you provided is structured for a single-class label per line, which typically indicates that each image can belong to multiple classes but lists the class numbers separately. However, this format will complicate the loading process for multi-label classification since it doesn't easily map images to multiple labels in a structured way.

Suggested CSV Format for Multi-Label Classification
To properly format your CSV file for multi-label classification, you should ensure that each image is represented by a single row, with each class represented by a separate column. Here’s how it should look:

Correct CSV Format Example

1. train_labels.csv

csv
Copy code
image_name,class1,class2,class3,class4,class5
image1.jpg,1,0,0,0,0
image1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0
image1.jpg,0,0,1,0,0
image2.jpg,1,0,0,0,0
image3.jpg,1,1,0,0,1
image4.jpg,0,0,1,1,1
Explanation of the Structure
First Column (image_name): Name of the image file.
Subsequent Columns (class1, class2, ..., class5): Each column corresponds to a class.
1 indicates that the class is present in the image.
0 indicates that the class is absent.
Note on the Suggested Format
In the suggested format, each image should appear only once in the CSV file with all its corresponding classes listed in one row. If an image can belong to multiple classes, indicate that with 1 in the appropriate class columns.

Alternative Approach (Long Format)
If you prefer to keep your current format (with multiple rows per image), you would need to preprocess the data to create a binary label representation as described above. Here’s how you could structure it in a way that still allows for easy multi-label classification:

Alternative CSV Example

If using a long format, you can create a mapping to convert it into a multi-label format:

2. train_labels_long.csv

csv
Copy code
image_name,class_id
image1.jpg,1
image1.jpg,2
image1.jpg,3
image2.jpg,1
image3.jpg,1
image3.jpg,2
image4.jpg,3
image4.jpg,4
image4.jpg,5
Processing Long Format into Multi-Label Format
If you choose to go with this long format, you'll need to convert it to a wide format when loading the data:

Read the long format CSV.
Create a binary matrix where rows are images and columns are classes.
Fill this matrix based on the presence of class IDs for each image.
Python Code Example for Processing Long Format
If you decide to keep the long format, here’s how to process it into a binary matrix format:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the long format CSV
long_labels = pd.read_csv('train_labels_long.csv')

# Create a binary matrix
binary_labels = long_labels.groupby('image_name')['class_id'].apply(lambda x: pd.Series(1, index=x)).unstack().fillna(0)

# Convert to 0 or 1
binary_labels = (binary_labels > 0).astype(int)

# Reset the index to use in the dataset
binary_labels.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Rename columns to match expected format
binary_labels.columns = ['image_name'] + [f'class{i}' for i in range(1, binary_labels.shape[1])]

# Save to CSV if needed
binary_labels.to_csv('train_labels.csv', index=False)
This way, you can keep your initial long format but still work with it effectively for multi-label classification tasks. If you need further clarification or help, feel free to ask!

Here’s how you can convert the long format CSV you've provided into the correct multi-label format.

Original Long Format CSV
train_labels_long.csv

csv
Copy code
image_name,class_id
image1.jpg,1
image1.jpg,2
image1.jpg,3
image2.jpg,1
image3.jpg,1
image3.jpg,2
image4.jpg,3
image4.jpg,4
image4.jpg,5
Converted Multi-Label Format CSV
After processing the long format, the converted multi-label format CSV would look like this:

train_labels.csv

csv
Copy code
image_name,class1,class2,class3,class4,class5
image1.jpg,1,1,1,0,0
image2.jpg,1,0,0,0,0
image3.jpg,1,1,0,0,0
image4.jpg,0,0,1,1,1

Note
since out dataset layout is 
image_name,class_id
image1.jpg,1
image1.jpg,2
image1.jpg,3
image2.jpg,1
image3.jpg,1
image3.jpg,2
image4.jpg,3
image4.jpg,4
image4.jpg,5

we could conver to the below format
image_name,class1,class2,class3,class4,class5
image1.jpg,1,1,1,0,0
image2.jpg,1,0,0,0,0
image3.jpg,1,1,0,0,0
image4.jpg,0,0,1,1,1

but instead we assigned a class name with number class mapping  in data load since the class name in csv file is string not number 
and a single file is repeated multiple time we group them for multi label classification
